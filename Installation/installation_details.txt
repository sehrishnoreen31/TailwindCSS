Tailwind CSS supports custom CSS at-rules like @tailwind, @apply, and @config, but these at-rules can trigger warnings or errors in many editors where they are not recognizable.
To solve those warnings and errors we will recommend you to install plugins on your IDE or editor so that will support the PostCSS instead of regular CSS.
